    <p>Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.Music is a great natural high and a great natural escape Where words leave off, music begins.Music is the shorthand of emotion.Music is the only thing I've ever known that doesn't have any rules at all.Research shows that music can also help you feel more confident, putting you in a mindset that's most likely to help you succeed—whether you're trying to hit a 10K personal best time or nail a public speaking event.</p>
    <p>Rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the Soul.I think music in itself is healing.</p>
